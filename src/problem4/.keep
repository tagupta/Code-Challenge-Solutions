Deploy a utility EVM contract with a function to retrieve all token balances given a 
wallet address and the token contract addresses.

I've tested the scripts for "development" network. 
So, the current addresses present in the test2.js are applicable to this network only. 
When you try to run the script, do modify the addresses as needed.

steps:
1. Change the working directory to "problem4" in terminal
2. For locally running the blockchain
   run: ganache-cli --allowUnlimitedContractSize --gasLimit 0x3B9AC9FF or run ganache UI
3. > truffle migrate
4. > update the address in test2.js
5. > truffle console
6. > test
